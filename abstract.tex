Data centres plays a fundemental role in the computing environment-from the Internet to the mobile cloud today. With rising development, the dramatically increasing energy consumption of data centres becomes a vital constraint and causes huge environmental impacts. Therefore, optimisation applications of data centres are demanded for both well computational performance and low energy consumption. From a software point of view, a runtime optimal task-scheduling approach will help multi-core based data centres to schedule target tasks efficiently with few resources and low energy cost. On the other hand, machine learning algorithms have shown the abilities to optimise multi-objective problems while being adaptive to the changeable circumstance in terms of different platforms. Thus, in this proposal, the main goal is to design an adaptive runtime scheduling approach for data centres using machine learning algorithms. Employing machine learning algorithms, the runtime optimisation software, which can be adaptive to changing hardware promotion and various platforms, needs to ensure the computation performance and low energy consuming of data centres.
