The landscape of computing is changing. Much of today's computation cycles are provided by data 
centres which suffer embarrassing energy inefficiencies: 
only a small fraction of a typical data centre's power is spent on useful work. 
The inefficiencies lead to worldwide energy waste measured in billions of pounds and tens of millions of metric tons of CO2. This has to change.
